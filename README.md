# Shortest-Path-And-Rhumb-Line
This project simulates the generation of shortest paths and rhumb lines between coordinates. It displays the final generated paths on a 2D plane and a 3D sphere. The project is created using Unity3d and provides the following features:

| Setting the start and end coordinates | Displaying the paths on a 2D plane and a 3D sphere |
